    <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <span class="highlight">2011:</span> I began my professional journey with then largest, third-party, pure-play Analytics unicorn <strong>Mu Sigma</strong>, in <strong>Bangalore, India</strong>.
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 7px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">My first client was a <strong>global pharmaceutical major</strong> based out of NJ, with an impressive roster of commercial products across <strong>cardiovascular, diabetes-management</strong>, and other therapeutic areas.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">I was part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) team that focused on <strong>statistical design, implementation and reporting/measurement of experimental marketing campaigns</strong>, with the goal of finding optimal mix between in-person and non-personal promotions.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">In the <strong>18 months</strong> with this client, I had helped the blockbuster diabetes brand <strong>improve sales</strong> with significant <strong>optimization of costs</strong> and cross-channel promotional touchpoints, designed and <strong>realized ROI</strong> from several non-personal marketing experiments, established data and analytics framework to <strong>operationalize close-loop marketing</strong> (CLM) and taken the client further along on their <strong>omni-channel maturity</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <span class="highlight">2013:</span> I transitioned to Mu Sigma's biggest client, <strong>Microsoft</strong>.
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 7px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Contributed significantly to the <strong>Windows Azure business</strong> by optimizing brand and marketing reporting systems, identifying B2C and B2B consumer segments and setting benchmarks for Customer Lifetime Value based on cloud utilization, exploration and adoption data.</li>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">I was <strong>recognized</strong> for my ability to connect data insights with impactful business interventions, leading to my transfer to Seattle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <span class="highlight">2014:</span> I moved to <strong>Seattle</strong>, to work in-person with my clients in the <strong>Windows App Store business</strong>.

                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Contributed significantly to Windows App Store ecosystem <strong>monetization goals</strong> and played key role in managing development of <strong>self-serve reporting and insights platform</strong>, liaising between multiple vendor companies to achieve target milestones.</li>

These projects have allowed me to develop a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the total pharma ecosystem.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">During this time, I have also actively seeked opportunities at non-pharma sector projects, to learn from and contribute inter-disciplinary and inter-industry perspectives to my own work and that of my colleagues and peers.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">I have also contributed my time to <strong>Pro Bono Consulting</strong> work. <strong>Youth</strong> and <strong>education</strong> are two causes close to my heart and I have worked very closely with a couple non-profits - CodeNation and Chicago HFS Scholars - to create strategic roadmaps and address their most pressing, immediate problems.</li>

            <h2>Headlines on what I have learnt</h2>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 7px;">
                <span class="highlight3">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Early and continued exposure to diverse business-driven, strategic technology problems have made me a well-rounded, adaptive, analytics and decision sciences professional with a solid understanding of various functional areas in Pharma (and other industries), their needs and priorities. <strong>I have inculcated the practice of starting with the underlying needs of the customers (internal, or external), which are not always recognized or communicated early</strong>.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">I have a nuanced appreciation for the complex and continuously evolving nature of the pharma life sciences business and the data challenges it entails. <strong>Traditional approaches and datasets will no longer suffice - a more connected, digital life will continue to change how patients and providers track and report health events and outcomes</strong>. Pharma companies need to be at the forefront of this evolution, backed by advances in the fields of data and analytics (including ML and AI).</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Through my professional exposure and personal experiences, <strong>I have developed a deep empathy for patients and their caregivers, and bring a 360-degree perspective</strong> to business problems and their solutions.</li></span>
